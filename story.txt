One day, some Advanced Topics in CS Students were tasked with figuring out how to use github. However, as they tried to figure it out, they realized the task was a huge <<NOUN>>. They tried multiple different methods, but could not get it to <<VERB>>. The students complained about how <<ADJECTIVE>> github was, and argued that they should use Google Docs instead as it is <<ADVERB>> simple. Fortunately, they eventually got it to work, and so they were happy.
