# MadLibs
1. First, have one person in each group, hereafter called the “owner”, clone the MadLibs project from my GitHub repository.  This creates a totally separate version of the project that will be independent of mine.

2. Then, each other person in the group should fork that person’s project.  This also creates a copy, but this allows you to make changes and contribute to that person’s project.

3. The owner must add each of the people in the group as collaborators.

4. Each person in the group should make one of the changes described in the Java file to that java file.  This will require both changing that Java file and also creating a new txt file, adding it to the repository.

5. When you make a change, ANY change, you must commit that change, writing a short comment about what the change is.  These “commits” keep a record of every change, and allow undoing of detrimental changes.

6. When you are fully satisfied with your changes, you should now push your changes back to the original, by creating a pull request (I know, you push by requesting a pull, what?!?).  The owner must then approve the pull requests and take care of the merge; if there are any merge conflicts, they should be shared and discussed to resolve.

7. Once the owner has merged everyone’s changes, they should test it to see if the program works!  If it does, great!

8. Now everyone else should pull the changes from the main so that they have an updated copy!

9. Finally, each person should edit some of the files they *didn’t* create to add stories, nouns, verbs, etc., commit those changes, and submit pull requests so that everyone is able to contribute to whichever files they’d like!
